Public Repository
-----------------

Some packages in this repository can be installed with `package.el`.
To enable this repository, add lines to your init file:

----
(setq package-archives
      `(,@package-archives
        ("10sr-el" . "http://10sr.github.io/emacs-lisp/p/")))
----


Updating
~~~~~~~~

Issue

----
make gh-pages
----

to build packages from current el files and commit them to `gh-pages` branch.
This command does not need the work tree be clean, but it is highly recommended.


If you want only to build packages without committing them to `gh-pages`, issue:

----
make archive-all
----

This puts built packages into `packages/` directory.
