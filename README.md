# emacs lisp

Emacs lisp libraries I wrote.

Currently these libraries do not follow conventions.

## pack.el

Pack or unpack files.

Command for pack/unpack can be defined by setting `pack-program-alist'.

## save-window-size.el

Library version of <http://www.bookshelf.jp/soft/meadow_30.html#SEC419>.

Automatically save and restore window size and position.

## gtkbm.el

Handle ~/.gtk-bookmarks.
