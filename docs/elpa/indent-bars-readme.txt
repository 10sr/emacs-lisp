indent-bars highlights indentation with configurable vertical bars,
using stipples.  The color and appearance (weight, pattern,
position within the character, zigzag, etc.) are all configurable.
Options include depth-varying colors and highlighting the
indentation depth of the current line.  Bars span blank lines, by
default.  indent-bars works in any mode using fixed tab or
space-based indentation.  In the terminal (or on request) it uses
vertical bar characters instead of stipple patterns.

For Developers:

To efficiently accommodate simultaneous alternative bar styling, we
do two things:

 1. Collect all the style related information (color, stipple
    pattern, etc.) into a single struct, operating on one such
    "current" style struct at a time.

 2. Provide convenience functions for replicating "alternative"
    custom style variables the user can configure; see
    `indent-bars--style'.  These variables can "inherit" nil or
    omitted plist variables from their parent var.

Note the shorthand substitution for style related slot;
see file-local-variables at the end:
